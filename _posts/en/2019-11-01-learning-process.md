[Portuguese Version]({{site.url}}/2019/11/01/processo-de-aprendizado)

Today I will speak about my process of learning and also highlight some points.

In nowadays, I feel comfortable to read and to write in English, but it wasn't like this. I took long to perceive how matter is this language. Many contents on the internet spoke about studying English and a day I decided to get out from comfort zone. Then I started with private classes. That was a good decision at that moment. It was cheaper than traditional schools and I would felt evolution, but I needed to stop. So, I downloaded the [Duolingo APP](http://duolingo.com) and carried on my studies. It was great, but I had doubts. To relieve them, I watched videos and read different explanations until I realize. Every day I practiced at least fifteen minutes. Whether I was getting and I wasn't tired then I tried to learn a new topic. The Duolingo has a goal system to students fulfill and it helped me to practice every day because I didn't would want to lose my score.

I perceived is that to start something new is very boring. Sometimes I think that I will not reach because it is hard and to break this feeling I need to feel evolution. It comes with practice and this one needs to be fun. I like to challenge myself to build a solution closer to the real-world that can be. For instance, to practice writing in English I've created this blog and to set my knowledge in Linear Regression [I've written this post]({{site.url}}/2019/10/14/simple-linear-regression). Whether I have fun in studies, it turns easier to learn. 

Also, I've figured out that to practice every day at least fifteen minutes need to be a rule until it turns a habit. I'm following it to learn more about data. Of course, this is for me, this text is about me and how I do to learn. I do not compare myself to other people. Each person has your routine. Some people to learn faster than others. I am honest with myself. I know where I am, what are my difficulties and what I need to do to solve them.

This text has no purpose to inspire or to motivate you. I wrote to share some points that I consider important and works for me when I want to learn a new thing like to play a musical instrument.

To finish I will leave a message that I like. It helps me a lot.
