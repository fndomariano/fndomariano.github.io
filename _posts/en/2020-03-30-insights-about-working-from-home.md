[Portuguese Version]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/30/percepcoes-sobre-home-office)

Always I worked inside companies and in occasional moments I worked from home. I never noted things that I list here.

The first point I realized was my concentration. At home, I have fewer distractions and because of that, I reach to resolve several tasks and I produced better. 

Other perception was communication. I started to send messages more detailed with the intent to not interrupt the person on another side with many useless messages. Before that, I generally spoke with people directly to be faster.

And the last insight was quality of life. I could slept more, left time, I not got stressed when I was coming back to home.
